resumen: "Recuperación de una ferrovía en desuso para crear un corredor de movilidad activa en el valle del elqui, región de Coquimbo"
texto-es: "lorem ipsum bla bla bla bla bla bla etc"
texto-en: "This is a proposal to recover an abandoned railway line, located in the Elqui Valley, 400 km north of Santiago, into a green corridor. This railway is a branch of the main trunk of Chile, and travels 90 km from the coastal city of La Serena into into Rivadavia, a small village surrounded by high Andean mountains. The particular geographic situation of this railway into a narrow valley made it the only transportation option, and its dismantling left many localities pretty much isolated from development and the tourism, which make up most of the local economy.
To highlight the potential of the route as a sustainable mobility corridor, Pedaleable.org made a diversity of plans, strategic interventions, events and projects, some of which are: pavilions, bike rides, reports, road signals and wayfinding, websites, publications, surveys and more. Some particular highlights of this work are the biodiversity pavilion, financed by the environment ministry, a complete geospatial survey of the railway with maps and a report made for the government, astronomy bike rides with local scientists and appearances in local and national newspapers and tv channels. Currently, the project needs the approval of the private company that owns the railway, Pedaleable.org has been trying to obtain it since 2015."
