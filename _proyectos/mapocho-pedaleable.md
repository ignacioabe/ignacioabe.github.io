## EN

This project is about the recovery of the Mapocho River, turning a neglected and abandonded urban space into a public one, integrating a quick and scenic cycleway and pedestrian promenade into the riverbed as strategic urban devices. The mapocho river, the most important of the Santiago, the capital of Chile, has been disconnected from the city, first used as a wastewater disposal (removed in the present) and then filled with urban highways which isolated it from the urban tissue and gave it fame of a dangerous and dirty place. The main intervention is the construction of a 7 km cycleway and walkway in the riverbed, in the most dense zone of the city and where most bridges are located (which the proposal conveniently bypasses).

This intervention is only possible because of the regime of the river, almost empty during most of the year, using its whole width only a few rainy days of the year and completely full only once every 50 years on average.
Many years of consistent work (through Pedaleable.org) have promoted the project in many different fronts, politic, social and technic and have it very close to its definitive concretion. Some proofs of this are the awards it has received (CAF, Santiago 2041 forum), the presidential priority awarded, the 10 MM USD of public funds reserved for its construction and than 13 thousand people that have visited the river and temporarily experienced the proposal the last time Pedaleable.org opened the river and paved a strip with asphalt (with the help of the local government and a private company).
